# Carol App Front-end Seed

The purpouse of this project is to work as a boilerplate for Web Apps developed to run on top of the Carol Platform.

It provides developers with a basic Angular app, bootstraped with the oficially supported [Carol FE SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@totvslabs/carol-app-fe-sdk) and the [PO UI](https://po-ui.io/) component library.

Developers can also use the various included samples to better understand how to implement an application with the Carol FE SDK, and how will their most common interactions with the Carol Platform look like.
